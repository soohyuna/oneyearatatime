      <description>In August of 2016, my cousin - Karen - and I hiked the East Coast Trail (ECT), from Cappehayden to St. John&amp;rsquo;s, Newfoundland and Laborador. We took hundreds of photos, and countless videoclips in the hopes of making a memoryclip of ourselves tackling the 200+km hiking trail over 2 weeks period. It took us 12 days and we ended up spending 2 days at St. John&amp;rsquo;s gaining back all the weight we lost, eating moose poutine and fish and chips, but it was all worth it.</description>
