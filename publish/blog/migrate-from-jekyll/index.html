<meta name="twitter:description" content="In August of 2016, my cousin - Karen - and I hiked the East Coast Trail (ECT), from Cappehayden to St. John&rsquo;s, Newfoundland and Laborador. We took hundreds of photos, and countless videoclips in the hopes of making a memoryclip of ourselves tackling the 200&#43;km hiking trail over 2 weeks period. It took us 12 days and we ended up spending 2 days at St. John&rsquo;s gaining back all the weight we lost, eating moose poutine and fish and chips, but it was all worth it."/>

<p>In August of 2016, my cousin - Karen - and I hiked the East Coast Trail (ECT), from Cappehayden to St. John&rsquo;s, Newfoundland and Laborador. We took hundreds of photos, and countless videoclips in the hopes of making a memoryclip of ourselves tackling the 200+km hiking trail over 2 weeks period. It took us 12 days and we ended up spending 2 days at St. John&rsquo;s gaining back all the weight we lost, eating moose poutine and fish and chips, but it was all worth it.</p>

<p><em>Here are the equipments we took on the trip</em>. We both were new to hiking long distance, so we do have some suggestions for those who are also tackling ECT (or PCT for that matter) for the first time without prior experience. Invest in a sturdy hiking shoes. Perhaps like those seen in the movie Wild. I don&rsquo;t know what I was thinking, but I thought I could do it in my running shoes. They were <strong>ruined</strong> in a half-day, soaked, teared and disgusting. Also, <strong>do not</strong> rely on granola bars/energy bars for sustenance. Dehydrate vegetables and rehydrate them using numerous fresh water sources along the trail. Otherwise, the consequences will be severe, even though it was only for two weeks. Remember to pack some dried fruit with you as well.</p>

<h2 id="essentials"><strong>Essentials</strong></h2>

<ol>
<li>50lb hiking backpack (Mine was Gregory Amber)</li>
<li>hiking boots (with or without ankle support - your preference)</li>
<li>compact tent (1-2 person), sleeping bag (below zero)</li>
<li>Water bottle with filter capability</li>
<li>hiking poles (they really help you get up the hills)</li>
<li>kerosene &amp; compact stove</li>
<li>small pots, cups, and cutlery</li>
<li>HEADLAMP (because you can get stuck walking in the middle of the night)</li>
<li>BUG SPRAY &ndash; they were not too terrible, but they can be irritating.</li>
<li>sunglassess (for sunny days)</li>
<li>Buffs (Great for keeping sweat off your face. I had a cap, but the wind blew it away on the first day)</li>
<li>Poncho for misty days</li>
<li>Ziplock bags to stow away smelly clothes</li>
<li>Socks that will dry quickly (also won&rsquo;t smell as bad)</li>
<li>ROLLed up toilet paper for you know when.</li>
<li>Most importantly: Food.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="food-what-s-for-dinner">Food: What&rsquo;s for dinner? 🍣 🍙 🍥</h2>

<p>Food wise, we went the simpliest, but perhaps the most expensive way of purchasing pre-packaged dehydrated meals called <strong>Backpacker&rsquo;s Pantry</strong> from the store <strong>Atmosphere</strong> in Kingston, Canada. They range from $9 CAD to $15, so they will add up if you are going to have one for dinner every single day. They are worth the cost, though. You will not believe how much calories you burn when you hike 8-10hrs a day. The Katmandu curry is delicious, so is the Pad Thai, and the Spicy Thai with Peanut Sauce. Check the calories on the back of the package to see how much you are consuming. Man, at the end of 12hr+ walk, we consummed it like it was all we had. I tried one for dinner after the trip, and I couldn&rsquo;t believe how much food there was in the package, which I had to separate into two meals. Then you wonder how you were able to consume all that food during the hike. And you want to go back for more (because you can eat so much more, really). <img src="/img/poutine.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="what-is-for-breakfast">What is for breakfast?</h2>

<p>Before covering dinner, I suppose what we had for breakfast needs to be covered. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, some would say. Modern life has made us accustomed to grabbing a cup of coffee and perhaps a bagel or muffin in the morning. How about a yogurt parfait, perhaps? You can&rsquo;t have a yogurt parfait for breakfast when you are our in the woods. You wake up most of the time TIRED, aching from the hike before. BUT you are hungry as heck, so you have no choice but to rummage through your backback, take out that kerosene, attach it to your mini-stove (your hands will be covered in soot in the process, but you don&rsquo;t care), cradle some fresh water into the pot, and boil up some oatmeal supplemented with all the wild blueberries you can find. There you have it. It is cliche to say this, but nothing tastes sweater than this bowl of oatmeal. You savour it, lick the bowl, take a big sigh out the mouth, take in the scenery, bring yourself back to the reality.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5WvqOxB.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>Pack up, and move on.</p>

<p>On the trail, expect to encounter changes of weather throughout the day. We hiked during the last two weeks of August, so the mornings were pleasantly warm with intermittent rain. BUT the evenings were COLD ❄️. My sleeping bag was not enough to keep me warm, so make sure you bring one that can keep you cosy below zero Celcius.</p>

<p>No matter how much you can plan ahead, the weather can have a major impact on how much you can accomplish in the day.  For example, the first two days of our hiking trip, the rain was relentless and non-stop. One of the trails had turned into a full-fledged stream of water, which we had to wade through. Our feet were soaked, but we ran into a pair of hikers in the same situation as us, drying their socks and shoes for the briefest period of sunny moment we had. We were thankful that the day before locals had taken us in. She saw us in our sorry state, fully soaked from head to toe, my green poncho ripped from walking through tree branches, and Karen more or less in a similar state. We were able to go back to their lodging and dry everything and wait for the rain to settle down. <strong>While you must stick to your pre-planned schedule, be aware that you might have to adjust if need be. Also take note that if this does happen and you are delayed by a day or two, you need to inform the pre-booked BnB or Airbnb (Whenever you get a chance of reception in the woods)</strong>.

<p>And of course, even though we carried bear bells to warn off any potential bears, there are NO BEARS at ECT. We did see a glimps of a moose, though, and they are better left by themselves. Of all wildlife we encountered, majority of them being avian, hearing and seeing Loons for the first time was the most memorable moment of the trip. Puffins are also abundant on the coastal regions. If you are lucky, you could see whales as well.</p>

<p>When you take a look at the coastline from St. John&rsquo;s to Cappehayden, the trail is connected by numerous Fishing towns. Some of them have Bed and Breakfast, or even Airbnb that you can book prior to launching on your hiking trip.  I would highly recommend booking them in advance if you are new to hiking long distance for the first time. After being on the trail for a couple of days, and you&rsquo;ve walked for grueling 8+ hours in the rain with wet feet, you will miss the comfort of a home when you finally settle in for the night in your tent. Also, taking a shower after being gross for a couple of days soaked and dried in rain and your own sweat, the warmth of the water is glorious.  You can also take ill during the trip.  You need to be vigilant of keeping your intestines happy. This isn&rsquo;t the time to try something new.  💩 So make sure that what you bring with you for sustenance is something you will be happy of eating for the duration of the trip.</p>

Try to purchase biodegradable ones, if possible&hellip;. They do burn well in the kerosene stove as well, but it is a terrible idea to incinerate anything while hiking. Open fire 🔥 is not advised on the trail.</h5>

<p>Suppose our hiking trip was a bit more glamorous compared to the typical thru-hike people may do. We do plan on doing the whole trail without relying on the accomodations. BUT, hiking long hours for many days can take a toll on you, and drain you mentally. It is challening because the terrain is not always flat. The coastal landscape is rugged with steep slopes both up and down. This is why hiking polls definitely are worth an investiment when you are tackling ECT (or any other trails).</p>

<p>Thank you for reading. And~
Thanks to all the volunteers who maintain the trail for all the hikers :)</p>
